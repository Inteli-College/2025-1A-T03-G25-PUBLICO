## 1. Introduction

The project continues to focus on the development of an intelligent platform for managing OKRs, enhanced by Artificial Intelligence and tailored for the context of a beverage company. The goal is to support organizations in setting and monitoring strategic objectives through a dynamic, data-driven solution that adapts to performance trends and market changes.

In this second development phase, the project advanced significantly in terms of design maturity, user interaction quality, and system performance. The work emphasized improving usability and visual coherence, while also enhancing the backend’s ability to handle data and AI suggestions efficiently.

## 2. Alignment with Proposed Schedule

The activities planned for the second module were completed in alignment with the updated schedule. The focus shifted toward frontend refinement, including the definition of a style guide and the creation of a detailed interface wireframe to guide visual and usability improvements.

Originally, some of these tasks were expected to happen later, but prioritizing user experience brought them forward. As a result, features such as dynamic and responsive components, error feedback messages, and a more intuitive layout were delivered within the timeframe. Backend enhancements were also developed in parallel to support these improvements without causing delays.

## 3. Evolution of the Project

During this second phase, key progress was made in both frontend and backend layers of the platform. A comprehensive style guide and wireframe were created to define the new visual identity and structure. These served as a reference for redesigning the interface, which is now more consistent, user-friendly, and responsive across devices.

Dynamic elements and feedback messages were added to improve user interaction, allowing better handling of errors and system states. The frontend was updated to match the new wireframe and now offers a more professional and cohesive experience.

On the backend, additional logic was implemented to support improved data visualization and deliver AI-generated suggestions more efficiently. An important improvement included in this module was the use of cache memory to store and serve recent OKR suggestions, reducing API response time and improving overall performance. UX optimizations were also applied to ensure smoother navigation and more meaningful user interactions throughout the platform.

## 4. Obstacles and Challenges

Throughout this phase, the main challenge involved balancing the redesign of the user interface with technical performance needs. Ensuring that the visual updates did not negatively impact the functionality required careful coordination between design decisions and backend behavior.

Another point of attention was the implementation of cache for AI suggestions. While this significantly improved response time, it required adjusting the data flow to avoid outdated information being presented to users. Error handling and feedback systems also need to be adjusted and support test iterations to ensure clarity and consistency across different usage scenarios.

## 5. Future Developments

The next steps will focus on finalizing advanced features such as user authentication, role management, and feedback collection on AI suggestions. These will increase platform security and allow user-specific experiences and permissions.

Additionally, further work will be done on refining performance—optimizing database queries and improving the scalability of the system for higher usage. Plans also include preparing the platform for deployment in cloud and conducting broader usability testing to validate the product in corporate context.

These final developments will support the transition from a structured prototype to a application ready to start being adopted by organizations.

## 6. Conclusion and Final Reflections

This second phase of the project aimed the importance of user-centered design and backend performance. By developing a clear style guide, wireframe, and interface enhancements, the platform started to turn into a more usable and visually coherent tool.

Backend upgrades and caching strategies proved essential in improving speed and responsiveness, while thoughtful UX improvements helped simplify user interaction.

The progress made so far lays a solid foundation for completing the platform in the final stage. With the integration of authentication, user roles, and final optimizations, the system is on track to deliver a complete, intelligent OKR management solution capable of supporting organizations in making smarter, data-informed decisions.
